# Just Todo it App

The Just Todo it app is a simple app that allows you to add things you need to accomplish with due dates to make it easier to "Just do it".

## Functionality

You can add tasks to the todo list and once you've finished them you can "check" them off. You can also add due dates to your tasks if you would like. If you no longer want to see a task on the todo list you can delete it whether it has been finished or not.

## Technology

JavaScript was coded using the OOP method.
